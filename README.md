# Rest-Riddle

This is a small webserver which serves the payloads and files for the Hacktoberfest 2021 event of the Hacktoberfest Munich Meetup.

The goal is to document the whole behaviour of the REST api in a separate GitHub project and open PRs with new findings.

## Compile / Run

To compile it from terminal just type the following in the project folder. This will create an artefact under `build/libs/`.

```shell
./gradlew bootJar
```

To start the project via terminal type:

```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```

The project can of course also be opened with any IDE, for myself I use IntelliJ IDEA.
